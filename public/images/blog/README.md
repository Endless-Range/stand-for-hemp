## Style Guide for All Blog Post Images

**Consistent Illustration Style:**
- Modern editorial illustration style (think New Yorker, Politico, or The Atlantic)
- Flat design with subtle textures and gradients
- Limited color palette: hemp green (#4A7C59), earth tones (warm browns, tans), accent colors per topic
- Geometric and organic shapes combined
- Professional but artistic - not corporate or alarmist
- **NO TEXT in any images** (text will be added by the blog post template)
- Horizontal format: 1200x630px

## california-hemp-ban.jpg

**Theme:** California economic warning/devastation

**Gemini Image Generation Prompt:**
```
Create a modern editorial illustration in a flat design style showing California's economic impact from hemp ban. Feature: stylized California state outline as central element, abstract downward-trending economic indicators (falling coins, broken supply chains), wilted hemp leaves or plants, warm earth tones (browns, tans) with hemp green (#4A7C59) and warning orange accents. Style should be similar to New Yorker or Politico illustrations - artistic, professional, not alarmist. Geometric shapes mixed with organic plant elements. Subtle textures and gradients. NO TEXT. Horizontal composition 1200x630 aspect ratio.
```

**Style Reference:**
- Think: New Yorker editorial illustration meets modern infographic art
- Mood: Serious but hopeful, factual not fearmongering
- NOT: Stock photos, corporate graphics, or cluttered designs
