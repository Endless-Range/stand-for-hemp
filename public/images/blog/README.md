- Flat design with subtle textures and gradients
- Limited color palette: hemp green (#4A7C59), earth tones (warm browns, tans), accent colors per topic
- Geometric and organic shapes combined
- Professional but artistic - not corporate or alarmist
- **NO TEXT in any images** (text will be added by the blog post template)
- Horizontal format: 1200x630px

## california-hemp-ban.jpg

**Theme:** California economic warning/devastation

**Gemini Image Generation Prompt:**
```
Create a modern editorial illustration in a flat design style showing California's economic impact from hemp ban. Feature: stylized California state outline as central element, abstract downward-trending economic indicators (falling coins, broken supply chains), wilted hemp leaves or plants, warm earth tones (browns, tans) with hemp green (#4A7C59) and warning orange accents. Style should be similar to New Yorker or Politico illustrations - artistic, professional, not alarmist. Geometric shapes mixed with organic plant elements. Subtle textures and gradients. NO TEXT. Horizontal composition 1200x630 aspect ratio.
```

**Style Reference:**
- Think: New Yorker editorial illustration meets modern infographic art
- Mood: Serious but hopeful, factual not fearmongering
- NOT: Stock photos, corporate graphics, or cluttered designs

## federal-hemp-ban.jpg

**Theme:** Federal hemp ban explanation - legislative/legal theme with educational tone

**Gemini Image Generation Prompt:**
```
Create a modern editorial illustration in a flat design style explaining the federal hemp ban. Feature: stylized US Capitol dome or government building silhouette, hemp leaves being restricted or confined (perhaps behind geometric barriers or legal document shapes), abstract representations of legislation (rolled documents, gavels simplified as shapes), interlocking geometric patterns suggesting complexity. Use hemp green (#4A7C59), navy/federal blue, earth tones (warm browns, tans), and subtle red accents for restriction. Style should be similar to New Yorker or Politico illustrations - artistic, professional, not alarmist. Geometric shapes mixed with organic plant elements. Subtle textures and gradients. NO TEXT. Horizontal composition 1200x630 aspect ratio. Mood: Informative and serious but not fearful, educational tone.
```

**Style Reference:**
- Think: Congressional quarterly meets New Yorker - serious legislative illustration
- Mood: Informative, educational, clear but not aggressive
- Visual metaphor: Legal restriction of a natural product
- NOT: Angry protest imagery, heavy-handed symbolism, or partisan graphics
